# Fearhim Project Setup - Changes Made

## Project Overview
**Fearhim** is a full-stack fashion-tech application with:
- **Frontend**: React + Vite + Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Express.js + PostgreSQL + Knex.js
- **Features**: User authentication, outfit generation, styleboards, AI integration

## Summary of Changes Made

### ‚úÖ **Critical Issues Fixed**

#### 1. **Environment Setup**
- **Created**: `backend/.env` file with necessary environment variables
- **Variables Added**:
  - `PG_CONNECTION_STRING`: Database connection string
  - `JWT_SECRET`: Authentication secret key
  - `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Placeholder for AI features
